# Affable Blogs!

Introduction:
-------------

There are tons of intellectuals out there whose writing has inspired me to what
I'm and what I want to be in my life. This list is an attempt to accrue them all
at one place for easy tracking and also make things easy for others when they
want to track blogs.

Quotes to remember:
-------------------
There are so many wonderful quotes that I keep reading that I finally thought I
need to dump them at one place. This is an effort toward that!

> ## Aristotle
> For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

> ## [Scott Patten](http://scotpatten.ca/2012/04/no-excuses.html)
> Stop making excuses. Go build something.
> The point is, that you can and should teach yourself some new skills. You're way closer to being employable than I was, that's for sure. It may take some evenings and weekends, but they'll be some of the most fun evening and weekends you have ever had. Find something you want to do and build it. Fall in love with that idea, but be ready to dump it for something better.

> ## John Resig
> It's important to note that I don't really care about the outward perception of GitHub flow chart. I think that's the most takeaway from this experiment: this is about a change that you're making in your life for yourself not a change that you're making to satisfy someone else's perception of your work. The same goes for any form of deiting or exercise: if you don't care about improving yourself then you'll never actually succeed.
