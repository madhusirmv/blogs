# Affable Blogs!

Introduction:
-------------

There are tons of intellectuals out there whose writing has inspired me to what
I'm and what I want to be in my life. This list is an attempt to accrue them all
at one place for easy tracking and also make things easy for others when they
want to track blogs.

Quotes to remember:
-------------------
There are so many wonderful quotes that I keep reading that I finally thought I
need to dump them at one place. This is an effort toward that!

> ## Aristotle
> For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

> ## [Scott Patten](http://scotpatten.ca/2012/04/no-excuses.html)
> Stop making excuses. Go build something.
> The point is, that you can and should teach yourself some new skills. You're way closer to being employable than I was, that's for sure. It may take some evenings and weekends, but they'll be some of the most fun evening and weekends you have ever had. Find something you want to do and build it. Fall in love with that idea, but be ready to dump it for something better.

> ## John Resig
> It's important to note that I don't really care about the outward perception of GitHub flow chart. I think that's the most takeaway from this experiment: this is about a change that you're making in your life for yourself not a change that you're making to satisfy someone else's perception of your work. The same goes for any form of deiting or exercise: if you don't care about improving yourself then you'll never actually succeed.

> ## Quora
> Get your work done first so you can play without guilt. Even better, make work play and the fun never ends!

> ## Quora
> If you're bored, you're doing it wrong.

> ## Quora
> The skills that will help your career most are the abilities to assimilate, communicate, and persuade. Keep learning!

> ## Random hearings
> If you believe in something even if the odds are stacked up against you, then GO FOR IT!

> ## Quora
> It truly matters what you think about. Think well be reading good books, building good, loving relationships, having good conversation, and imtatiting good people.

> ## Quora
> Failure is an opportunity; no great man or woman ever achieved significance without great failures. Fail forward!

> ## Quora
> Don't look down on others because they don't what you didn't earn: your intellect, your beauty, and your culture of birth are underserved gifts. Stay humble!

> ## Quora
> Ultimately privacy is a myth; God sees everything. The cloud records everything. NSA files everything. So, live transparently and don't waste useless energy hiding failures.


> ## Quora
> Don't complain. Either change your sitation, learn to cope, or change perspective.


> ## Quora
> Find a passion. Pick a hobby, own it; photography, juggling - whatever. Get your 10K hours of perfect practice in early and change your life.
